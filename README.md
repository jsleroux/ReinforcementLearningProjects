### This repository contains experiments that I did to learn more about reinforcement learning.

#### Reinforcement Learning module in UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI
My first introduction to the subject was from the course CS188 from Berkeley (http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html). It is an undergrand course. The learning framework is around a pacman game, so it's very intuitive, visual and fun! The learning objectives were the following:
1- Markov Decision Process (Value Iteration)
2- Q-Learning and approximate Q-Learning

#### Multi-Armed bandit - https://github.com/jsleroux/ReinforcementLearningProjects/blob/master/Multi_Armed_Bandits.ipynb
A multi-armed bandit example. The objective of this project were:
- Try and reproducte Sutton and Barton's famous 10-armed Testbed
- E-greedy policies
- 

#### OpenAI gym's
From the PacMan course, the next logical step for me was to try and solve benchmarks that OpenAI proposes.
